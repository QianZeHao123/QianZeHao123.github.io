# 0x01 Introduction and Features

* FreeLeek is an open-source server-side framework that unifies the back-end services of the Free Leek Foundation by using Python Flask, Tushare Pro, and Akshare to transfer financial data to the application backend and WeChat platform.
* FreeLeek can automatically push financial news to the WeChat public platform to which users subscribe.
* Function expansion: By editing Python scripts and docker files, you can quickly start multiple services, such as quantitative trading algorithms, position management systems, etc., and you can easily customize more functions.

### For the encapsulation of WeChat template information

The FreeLeekWeChat() class is defined in the src/wx_send_msg.py file, instantiates the class where it needs to be called, and passes in appid, secret, openid, template_id, template_data 5 parameters, and implements the information by executing post_data(). There is a detailed document in the project documentation explaining how to obtain the 5 parameters:

### Functional extensions through Docker

Custom functions can be added directly by writing Python scripts and dockerfile files, filling in the container name, local port number, etc. in the docker-compose.yaml file in the root directory, and directly running sudo docker-compose up -d in the terminal without affecting the operation of other functions.

# Run the project

It runs the sample function in the warehouse and regularly pushes financial news to WeChat, but leek friends can customize the function according to their needs!

### Step 1 clone the project to the local computer

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/qian_zehao/free-leek.git
```

### Step 2 Modify the configuration file & message template (config.yaml and message_template.json)

```yaml
wx_interface:
  appid: "<server appid>"
  secret: "<server secret>"
  openid: "<user wechat id>"
  template_id: "<user template_id>"

tushare_tocken: "<Your tushare token>"

time_interval: <set wx_msg_send interval>
```

Make sure that the json variables in message_template.json are consistent with those in the WeChat template message.

```json
{
    "title0": {
        "value": "FreeLeek Unit Test 0",
        "color": "#173177"
    },
    "content0": {
        "value": "This is freeleek quant trade foundation, welcome your coming!"
    },
    "title1": {
        "value": "FreeLeek Unit Test 1",
        "color": "#173177"
    },
    "content1": {
        "value": "This is freeleek quant trade foundation, welcome your coming!"
    }
}
```

### Step 3 Run this project

Execute the following command in the root directory of the project, it's as simple as that~

```shell
# build images
$ sudo docker-compose build
# Run
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
# stop & delete
$ sudo docker-compose down
```
