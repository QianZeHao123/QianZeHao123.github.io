ðŸ¥³ I bought an industrial control computer from a second-hand e-commerce platform, and after a period of playing, I found that its performance was good.

* Hardware Info: CPU (2 cores, J1800, 2.41GHz), RAM 4G, DISK 60G, no GPU.
* OS: I installed the Ubuntu operating system on it, and Linux runs more smoothly on this device.
* System Software: Docker and git.

### My Opinion
We have always been looking for hardware devices, such as higher performance CPUs and GPUs, larger memory and hard disks. But considering that personal servers need to run 24/7, and some programs need to run reliably. Some of my current projects, such as the financial data monitoring programs at Free Leeks, need to run all the time and automatically restart when the program crashes. Using an industrial control computer is the best choice, and these industrial products are really very cheap (about 200 RMB per IPC).
